This Python code simulates a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) using the LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) protocol. It models sensor nodes, energy consumption, packet loss, and cluster head formation to study the performance of the network. The code generates output data like Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and End-to-End Delay (E2E Delay), saving results to an Excel file.
